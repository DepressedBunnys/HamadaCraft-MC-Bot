# Hey again 

### Find.JS
It's just a code snippet that you paste into stats.js
- What does it do:
> Search for the stats of a specific item

### Stats.JS
The main file, setup is explained in [here](https://github.com/DepressedBunnys/HamadaCraft-MC-Bot)

### Leaderboard.JS
Just like Find.JS, it's just a snippet but it won't work copy paste, it uses mongoDB and JavaScript logic to sort the leaderboard
